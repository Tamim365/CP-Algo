    * weights can be negative.
    * detects negative weight cycle.
    * Initially, the size of the distance (i, i) is zero. 
    * A path [i, kâ€¦i] can only improve upon this if it has a length less than zero, i.e., denotes a negative cycle. 
    * Thus, after the algorithm, (i, i) will be negative if there exists a negative-length path from i back to i.
